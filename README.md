The result [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kmUJBEjTM9AaVXt_Cd_I2kif1Y99rwpd9gdsyaNQdRc/edit?usp=sharing).

### Homework 4 (29.09 - 13.10):
1. (4 points) An set interface class (insertion, deletion, search, union, intersection). Two implementations of this
 interface: an AVL tree, an hash table.
You are welcome to make a map interface and its implementations instead of a set.

### Homework 5 (13.10 - 27.10):
In this homework you can use whatever you want for organizing concurrency.

1. (2 points) A parallel increment without synchronization.
2. (3 points) A parallel mergesort.

### Homework 6 (20.10 - 03.11):
1. (4 points) The tic-tac-toe game. Console and GUI interfaces. Tests
for logical and console interface parts.
2. * (4 points) The same task as 1st one, but on an infinity field.
3. (4 points) Code review of 1st task.

### Homework 7 (27.10 - 10.11):
1. (4 points) A generic abstract class of an ordered list. It should implement `Comparable`. Two implementations: with arrays and with lists.
Custom `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods must be implemented.
You can't use containers from the standard library, except ordinary arrays. This task must be solved on Java.
2. (2 point) Rewrite previous task on Kotlin using data classes.

### Homework 8 (03.11 - 17.11):
1. (4 points) An `Iterable` implementation for containers from the problem 4.1.
